       "- It creates a set of all non-empty authors from the list (or iterable) of books, then yields each author from that set to the caller. So you get each unique author, once, in no particular order.\n",

       "This line of code is using a feature called **generator expressions** and the `yield from` keyword, which can be a bit tricky for beginners. I'll break it down step by step.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Generator Expression**\n",
       "------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "A generator expression is similar to a list comprehension or a set comprehension, but instead of computing a new value for each item in the input iterable, it produces a **generator**. A generator is a special type of object that remembers its state between successive calls and can be used as if it were an iterator.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this case, the generator expression is:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "```\n",
       "Here's how it works:\n",
       "\n",
       "* `for book in books`: This iterates over the elements of the `books` list/set/other iterable.\n",
       "* `if book.get(\"author\")`: This filters out any books that don't have an \"author\" key. If a book is filtered out, its value (i.e., `None`) will not be included in the resulting set.\n",
       "\n",
       "**yield from**\n",
       "-----------------\n",
       "\n",
       "The `yield from` keyword is a way to yield values from another iterator. When used with a generator expression, it allows us to \"nest\" one generator expression inside another.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this code:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "```\n",
       "We're creating an iterator that yields authors from the `books` list, but instead of calling `list()` or `set()` on the original dictionary values, we're using `yield from`. This is equivalent to writing:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "for author in {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "    yield author\n",
       "```\n",
       "However, `yield from` is a more concise and efficient way to achieve the same result.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why?**\n",
       "---------\n",
       "\n",
       "So why would we use `yield from` here instead of just using a regular generator expression or iterating over the values directly?\n",
       "\n",
       "The reason is that if we used a regular generator expression, it would produce an iterator that yields individual authors one by one. If we want to collect all these authors into a single set, we'd need to wrap it in another loop.\n",
       "\n",
       "But with `yield from`, we're creating an iterator that directly produces the desired output: a set of authors. This makes the code more readable and efficient!\n",
       "\n",
